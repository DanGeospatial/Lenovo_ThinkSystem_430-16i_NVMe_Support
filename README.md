# Lenovo_ThinkSystem_430-16i_NVMe_Support
This repository is a guide on how I flashed the firmware and bios on a Lenovo 430-16i (LSI 9400-16i) to enable U.2 NVMe support. By default, Lenovo disables NVMe on this card but it uses the idential chip to the 9400-16i so it can be crossflashed with that card's bios/firmware.
